# Inventory

- An Ansible inventory file is a fundamental component of Ansible that defines the hosts that you want to manage and the groups that the hosts belong to.

- The inventory file can be static (a simple text file) or dynamic (the script generates it). It provides Ansible with the information about the remote notes communicated during operations.
